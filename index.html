  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>
    Some C++, and Arduino, and a blinking LED changed my life forever. I had been working as a manufacturing engineer for a few years but it was slowly 
    dawning on me that it wasn't the field I wanted to be in. Fast forward through two years of building Ardino projects and learning to code and I quit 
    my manufacturing job to become a software developer. I enrolled in Turing School of Software and Design's Backend Engineering program, and after
    7 months of intense schooling I graduated with a job as a software engineer.
  </p>
  <p>
    I focus mainly on backend tech but enjoy working across the stack. Recently I've been working with some awesome tech 
    in the cloud focusing mainly on serverless technologies in AWS, specifically around the SAM framework, along with ETL pipelines.
  </p>
  <p>
    I love the creative aspects of software engineering, the nonstop learning, the challenging nature of it, and the "wow, I built that?!" feeling
    that comes with all of engineering. I'm always pushing myself to be a better engineer and help raise others with me.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of my other interests include building arguably-useless but arguably-awesome Arduino projects, 3D printing my own designs to solve problems
    around the house, 3D printing useless cool toys for myself or others, playing music, traveling, and enjoying the outdoors.
